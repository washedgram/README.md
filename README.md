# Hi!

My name is gram. I like science, technology, sneakers, e-commerce, photography, contemporary art, running, and Thai food (in no particular order). Thanks for stopping by my page!

ðŸ§¬ Building powerful solutions to biomedical research questions on my quest towards a PhD in computational genetics.

Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/washedgram) or open an issue if you have a question about one of my open-source repos. I don't really keep them up-to-date unless someone asks me about one, so take that as you will. I'm always interested in a new adventure, so if you want something built that doesn't exist yet, my DMs are always open.
