# Hello!

Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! I like science, technology, sneakers, e-commerce, contemporary art, running, table tennis, and Thai food (in no particular order). 

ðŸ§¬ Building powerful solutions to biomedical research questions on my quest towards a PhD in computational genetics. 

ðŸ‘Ÿ Playing cat-and-mouse with your favorite e-commerce companies in my free time.
