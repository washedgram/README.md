# Hi!

My name is gram. I like science, technology, sneakers, e-commerce, photography, contemporary art, running, and traveling (in no particular order). Thanks for stopping by my page!

ðŸ§¬ Building powerful solutions to computational genetics research questions on my quest towards a PhD and never managing to leave school.

ðŸ‘Ÿ Playing cat-and-mouse with your favorite e-commerce solutions and collecting clout tokens [online](https://twitter.com/washedgram) when I'm bored.

Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/washedgram) or open an issue if you have a question about one of my open-source repos. I don't really keep them up-to-date unless someone asks me about it, so take that as you will. I'm always interested in a new adventure, so if you want something built that doesn't exist yet, my DMs are always open.

If you want to make a frontpage README like this, create a repo named after your GitHub username, populate a README.md file, then click the button the right side of the screen and it will be made public.
